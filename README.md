# API-CP Template Repository

This is a template repository for Common Platform (CP) APIs in HMCTS. It defines naming conventions, structure, and validation tooling for OpenAPI specifications.

The repository template and its associated build workflows are designed to support a single API specification per repository.

> 🔗 API definitions should follow the [HMCTS RESTful API Standards](https://hmcts.github.io/restful-api-standards/).

## Naming Convention

> NOTE: Avoid using terms like `common, core, base, utils, helpers, misc, or shared`.
> These names often allow for ambiguous ownership and quickly become black holes where cohesion goes to die.

Repository names follow a pattern from generic to specific:

```
api-cp-[case-type]-{product-domain}-{name-of-entity}
```
The optional `case-type` parameter could be:

* civil 
* crime 
* family 
* tribunal

HMCTS manages all Civil, Criminal, Family (separate from civil), and Tribunal cases.

### Reference Data Repositories

Reference data APIs use the following naming format:

```
api-cp-refdata-{product-domain}-{name-of-entity}
```
Some might argue that `product-domain` should be optional for reference data, placing it under global ownership. But global ownership often means no ownership — and no accountability. Therefore, `product-domain` is **required**.

## Post-Template Manual Steps

### Setup

* Go to settings of the repository -> General -> check "Automatically delete head branches"
* Import the ruleset `.github/rulesets/master.json`  
  To import the ruleset, follow GitHub’s instructions here:  
  👉 [Importing a ruleset](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/managing-rulesets/managing-rulesets-for-a-repository#importing-a-ruleset)
  
Once the ruleset has been successfully imported via GitHub Settings, the new repository no longer requires `.github/rulesets/master.json` so it **should be deleted**:

### Clean Up

After using this template to create your repository, the following files are no longer needed and **should be deleted**:

- `./docs/*`
- `./src/main/resources/openapi/deleteme`

Update the `./README.md` to reflect the context of the new created repository

## Supporting Documents

The [`docs`](./docs) directory includes supporting information for the repository:

- [`API-VERSIONING-STRATEGY.md`](./docs/API-VERSIONING-STRATEGY.md) – How we version APIs using media types and SemVer.
- [`CHAIN_OF_CUSTODY.md`](./docs/CHAIN_OF_CUSTODY.md) – Steps taken to establish a secure software supply chain and audit trail.
- [`DATA-PRODUCTS.md`](./docs/DATA-PRODUCTS.md) – Description of structured data outputs generated by the API.
- [`GITHUB-ACTIONS.md`](./docs/GITHUB-ACTIONS.md) – Overview of GitHub Actions workflows, including secrets and variables.
- [`OPENAPI-FILE-CONVENTIONS.md`](./docs/OPENAPI-FILE-CONVENTIONS.md) – OpenAPI file and content conventions.
